# FGallery-with-Video - A Media Gallery for iOS
## Overview
This code is based on FGallery-iPhone by Grant Davis (https://github.com/gdavis/FGallery-iPhone). Original work covers static images, so I am trying to extend it to incorporate videos (both local and remote sources). Also using ASIHttpRequest for easy image caching. The work is not completed yet, but works thoroughly, although not smooth.
